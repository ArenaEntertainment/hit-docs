title: Are There Any Trading Limits?
description: Understanding trading limits and liquidity on Hit
---

Hit does not impose fixed trading limits on how many shares you can buy or sell. However, the practical limit to your trading is determined by the available liquidity in each market.

### Liquidity Constraints

While there are no artificial caps on trade sizes, Hit cannot guarantee that you can transact your desired amount without significantly impacting the market price. The actual constraint is the depth of available orders in the market's order book.

### How Liquidity Affects Your Trades

**Market Depth** - The number of shares available at various price levels determines how much you can trade:

- Deep markets with many orders can absorb larger trades.
- Shallow markets with fewer orders may move significantly on smaller trades.

**Slippage** - When you place a large market order, you may experience price slippage:

- Your order fills at progressively worse prices as it consumes available liquidity.
- The larger your order relative to available liquidity, the more slippage you'll experience.

### Trading Strategy Tips

- **Check the order book** before placing large trades to understand available liquidity.
- **Use limit orders** to specify your worst acceptable price.
- **Split large orders** into smaller trades over time to minimize market impact.
- **Trade during active periods** when liquidity tends to be higher.
