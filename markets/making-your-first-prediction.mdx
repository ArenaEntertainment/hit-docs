### How to Trade

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Market">
    Browse [available markets](https://hit.com) and pick an event you're interested in

    **Good first markets:**
    - Simple HIT/MISS questions.
    - Topics you know well.
    - Short-term events (resolve within days or weeks).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand the Question">
    Read the market question and resolution criteria carefully:
    - What exactly is being asked?
    - When does the market close?
    - How will it be resolved?

    **Example:** "Will Bitcoin reach $150K by December 31, 2025?"

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check the Current Odds">
    Look at the current prices:
    - **HIT at 35¢** = 35% chance of happening.
    - **MISS at 65¢** = 65% chance of not happening.

    Prices always add up to \$1.00.

  </Step>

<Step title="Decide What to Buy">
  Choose your position: - Buy **HIT** if you think the event will happen - Buy
  **MISS** if you think it won't happen.
</Step>

<Step title="Place Your Trade">
  Enter your trade amount: Start with a small amount (\$5 - \$10). Review the
  expected outcome. Click "Buy" to confirm.
</Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Your Position">
    Track your trade in your portfolio:
    - Current value of your shares.
    - Profit/loss if you sold now.
  </Step>
