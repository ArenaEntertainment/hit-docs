title: Signing Up
description: Get started with Hit in minutes
---

Click the **Login** button and choose your sign-up method:

- **Email Sign Up** – Create an account with your email address.
- **Google Login** – Sign up instantly with your Google account.
- **Connect Wallet** – Use an existing crypto wallet.

### Wallet Setup

Once you sign up, Hit automatically creates two wallets in the background:

1. **Privy Wallet** – An app-specific intermediary wallet that's fully self-custodial. You can export the private key anytime from your account settings.

2. **Smart Contract Wallet** – A smart contract wallet owned by your Privy wallet. This enables gasless transactions and a seamless trading experience without needing to manually approve every blockchain interaction or pay gas fees.

This setup process takes about a minute. You're ready to use the site once you see your portfolio value (initially \$0.00) in the header bar.

  **Mobile Trading:** For the best mobile experience, we recommend using Email
  or Google sign-up rather than wallet connection.
