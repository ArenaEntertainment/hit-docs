A prediction market is a platform where you trade shares on future events. Hit operates as a decentralized exchange for event outcomes.

### How It Works

- **Trade event outcomes** – Buy and sell shares in binary outcomes like "Will candidate X win the election?"
- **Share pricing** – Each share trades between \$0.00 and \$1.00.
- **Settlement** – When an event resolves, winning shares pay out \$1.00.
- **Peer-to-peer trading** – You trade directly with other users, not against a house.

### Prices Reflect Probability

Share prices represent the market's collective estimate of an event's probability. A share trading at $0.40 suggests a 40% chance of that outcome occurring.

As new information emerges, traders adjust their positions, and prices update to reflect the latest consensus probability.

### How You Profit

- **Buy YES** when you think an event is more likely than the current price suggests.
- **Buy NO** when you think an event is less likely than the price indicates.
- **Sell early** to lock in profits or cut losses before the event concludes.

The spread between your entry and exit price, multiplied by your position size, determines your profit or loss.
